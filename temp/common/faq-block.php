                <p>What kind of maintenance does my bike need?</p>
                <p>Pumping the tires timely, greasing the chain whenever it starts to feel dry or make squeaky noises, and keeping the transmission clean is mandatory for a bikeâ€™s long and healthy life. Periodic inspection by a bike mechanic is also very important in order to address any issues that may arise in the meantime.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-12 question">
                <p>What kind of lube do you recommend?</p>
                <p>We recommend you to use a non-petroleum lubricant on your bike because a petroleum one would pick up a lot of dirt.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-12 question">
                <p>How much air do I put in my tires?</p>
                <p>You need to look carefully to determine how much air does your tyre actually need. A keen observation goes a long way. For further information, please visit our store and let a bike specialist inspect it for you.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-12 question">
                <p>How often should I pump my tires?</p>
                <p>It comes down to your tires and their size. Different types and different sizes need different amount of pressure. Some of the bike tires require to be pumped up at least once a week, others might need it every two weeks, and some of them might go up to three weeks without any trouble.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-12 question">
                <p>Why do I have to pump my tires so often?</p>
                <p>The tire contains a minimal amount of air in it. But this minimal amount  is held under a great deal of pressure and it doesn't take long for a tire to loose enough air to become soft and sluggish.</p>

                <p>What if I am not free during your regular operating hours? Can you send someone from your workshop to my home?</p>
